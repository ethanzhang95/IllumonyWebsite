                                    Elizabeth Sun is a junior at TJHSST and the founder of Illumony. When she was in third grade, she joined a STEM afterschool club and was welcomed
                                    into the exciting world of math and science. Since fifth grade, she has been participating in math competitions such as MathCounts, the AMC/AIME
                                    series and Math Kangaroo, as well as Science Olympiad and the science fair. She is currently a finance officer for her school’s Varsity Math Team
                                    (VMT) and spends much of her free time conducting her own research in biotechnology at TJ’s Jefferson Underclassmen Multidisciplinary Project lab. <br> <br />

                                    An avid reader and writer, she is also an active staff writer of tjTODAY, the school-wide student news online and print publication. She has published 22 articles
                                    (and counting) on <a href="https://tjTODAY.org">tjTODAY.org</a> and on the monthly print magazine. She will lead the Social Media Team during the 20-21 school year.
                                    In her free time, she likes to write poetry, listen to music, and bake. <br /> <br />

                                    “I think the amount of exposure to STEM at a young age isn’t emphasized enough,” She said when she was interviewed by tjTODAY. “I was fortunate
                                    enough to grow up in an environment rich with opportunities that allowed me the freedom to explore topics I found interesting, but there are so many kids who
                                    don’t have those opportunities that I want to connect with.” <br /> <br />

                                    As the leader of Illumony, she oversees all projects and directs the team in carrying out their ideas. She recognizes that the next generation will lead at the 
                                    frontier of mathematical and scientific innovation. Through her work in the community, she hopes to see her own drive and curiosity reflected in the eyes of the future.

                                    Ethan Zhang is a sophomore at TJHSST who is enthusiastic about the field of computer science, specifically cybersecurity and programming. 
                                    He has been a member of his schools' Cyberpatriot team since middle school, winning the top spot in Virginia, and has also competed in the 
                                    national Platinum tier as a member of TJHSST's Cyberpatriot team. Ethan's interest in STEM is rooted in his previous participation in science 
                                    and math activities, such as Science Olympiad and Math Counts. 
                                    <br /><br />
                                    When volunteering at several elementary schools to help younger students with STEM, Ethan realized that the educational opportunities and 
                                    resources he received are not available to many students in the community. He joined Illumony to help share his passion for cybersecurity 
                                    and math via online tutoring, especially as distance learning is becoming the new norm. 
                                    <br /><br />
                                    In his spare time, Ethan enjoys reading, playing the saxophone, and participating in travel ice hockey.

                                    Curtis Ji is currently a junior at TJHSST. He is the Chief Technology Officer, and thus manages
                                    the website and the technical backend of the operation. Furthermore, he was a volunteer Computer
                                    Science teacher, and helped pass on his knowledge to the next generation of computer programmers.
                                    He was also an assistant instructor at Fairfax Collegiate, and was inspired by the love of learning
                                    he saw in his pupils to help spread that knowledge through free initiatives to reach more people.
                                    A Captain and Varsity level runner of the Thomas Jefferson Track Team, Curtis realized that a lot of
                                    people wish to learn more information, but simply lack the means to access reliable information. Thus,
                                    Curtis now works with Illumony to help provide  knowledge in order to inspire the next generation of
                                    learners. In his free time, he enjoys reading nonfiction, particularly about WWII and keeping up with
                                    new technological innovations.

                                    Kevin Zhang,a junior at TJHSST, is the Chief Marketing Officer of Illumony. He is a proud member of the math and physics team, which
                                    he utilizes as outlets to share the elegance of both fields. Encouraged by the excitement of new
                                    discoveries, he continues to explore STEM by reading books and adding numbers. He remarks that
                                    "even as children, we have an innate sense of the largeness of numbers or the blueness of the
                                    ocean, and science is a beautiful way of communicating these abstract ideas." Inspired by his
                                    academic upbringing, Zhang works with Illumony to spread scientific curiosity to a diverse audience
                                    by showcasing the joy/teamwork in STEM and empowering future pioneers. In his free time, he likes
                                    to count by 17s and solve the even-numbered clues to the daily NYT crossword puzzle.

                                    Derek Dong, a junior at TJHSST, is the Chief Strategy Officer of Illumony. He enjoys doing math for fun. Starting as early as
                                    elementary school, he has been a participant in math competitions like MathCounts and the AMCs.
                                    In high school, he has had the honor of representing TJ at math contests across the nation and
                                    wants to provide the opportunity for more people to discover the allure of math often absent in
                                    traditional curriculums. To that effect, he serves as the statistician of TJ’s Varsity Math Team
                                    and is in his second year of co-teaching a middle school math club. Dong especially enjoys seeing
                                    each student in the class energetically display their unique personalities as they learn novel and
                                    unexpected mathematical concepts. 
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    “To a lot of people, math is something mechanical that’s meant to
                                    be memorized for a test and forgotten shortly afterwards. But it’s really a way of thinking that’s
                                    objective and carefully reasoned out, while still actively involving a creative mindset,” Dong said.
                                    
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Besides math, Dong enjoys working on computer science and more recently has become engaged in TJ’s
                                    Urban Dance Movement. He attributes his success in the former, such as qualifying for the Platinum
                                    division of the USA Computing Olympiad, to the fundamental reasoning skills he acquired from math.
                                    Dong favors Python and Java, but he is also familiar with C++, C, and LaTeX typesetting. Dong recognizes
                                    that he has had many opportunities afforded to him in his development mathematically and personally,
                                    and wants to provide service to his local community in return through Illumony. In the future, he
                                    wants to study mathematics and machine learning and additionally volunteer his services to the
                                    competition math world he has enjoyed for so long.

                                    Aaliya Hussain, a junior at TJHSST, is the Chief Finance Officer of Illumony. She appreciates all things biology- and chemistry-related. A proud competitor
                                    in the Science, USA Biology, and US National Chemistry Olympiads, she credits public library summer programs
                                    for her deep interest in science. “The kind librarians we ho madslime with borax and glue and volcanoes with
                                    vinegar and baking soda were the ones who first inspired me to study science,” she recalls. Her mission at
                                    Illumony is to repay the generosity she has received by providing STEM enrichment opportunities to underprivileged children. <br /> <br />

                                    In her spare time, Hussain enjoys skimming news headlines, searching for the next great novel to read, and flipping through science magazines.

                                    Tiffany Cheng is a junior at TJHSST and an active volunteer of Illumony. At a young age, she was fascinated by the field of STEM. In order to pursue her interests, she started to focus on competition math, participating in competitions such as MathCounts and AMC/AIME series. Here at TJ, she continues this enthusiasm through her choice of classes and after school activities, signing up for advanced science-based courses in biology, chemistry, and physics, as well as lab-based courses such as DNA Science. Also a passionate presenter, Cheng is also the publicist of the TJ Public Forum Debate Team. Knowing that children in the same community do not have access to the same opportunities as she does, she currently sponsors the debate team at Holmes Middle School. Yet, hoping to introduce STEM to those in similar situations, she decided to volunteer at Illumony and provide them an opportunity to enjoy the activities she considers are worth a lifetime.

                                    Mirza Hilal Hussain is currently a sophomore at TJHSST. Ever since he attended his first math club afterschool meeting in 4th grade, he has loved math, especially competition math. He has earned state and national level distinctions in several math competitions, including ARML, MathCounts, and the AMC/AIME series. After founding a competition math club at Carson Middle School, he joined TJ’s Varsity Math Team in his freshman year.
                                    “As someone who came to love math at a pretty young age,” Hussain explains, “I definitely understand the importance of providing learning opportunities to all kids.” Through Illumony, Hussain hopes to guide and inspire underprivileged children to discover their own STEM interests.
                                    Hussain also enjoys computer science, currently qualifying for USACO Gold, and serves as a captain on TJ’s Varsity Football Team. A violinist since middle school, Hussain also plays as part of the Musikfest Orchestra. He enjoys lifting weights, cracking math and computer science puzzles, and playing video games in his free time.

                                    the arts led to a passion for creativity and exploration, especially in reading and language, as reflected in Victoria’s participation in Speech 
                                    and Debate. As a captain of Langley Speech and Debate, she competes in both Junior Varsity Public Forum and Varsity Lincoln Douglas debates, as 
                                    well as Original Oratory speeches - placing first at regionals. Although interested in humanities, she is no less enthusiastic about math and sciences. 
                                    She is a Science Olympiad captain and the secretary of Math Honor Society. <br /> <br />
                                    Being fortunate enough to have access to resources and mentors, she recognized 
                                    the importance of opportunity and potential in the community, and she wishes to do her part in uplifting the community in the small ways she knows best.
                                    In her non-academic time, she often helps out with her family restaurant, eat good food, listen to good music, and doodle creatures of the imagination.

                                    Victoria Chen is a junior at TJHSST. When the Covid-19 crisis began, Victoria realized she 
                                    is one of the privileged students who have access to medical help and supplies. As the 
                                    publicist of TJ’s UNICEF club and as a member of the global community, Victoria felt obligated 
                                    to help by offering her knowledge and expertise to Illumony. In addition to serving the community, 
                                    Victoria loves to teach. Being TJ Art Club’s Activities Coordinator allows her to conduct demos 
                                    and give presentations about her passions. <br /><br />

                                    As a biology connoisseur, Victoria has taken AP Biology and is planning to take Neurobiology 
                                    and Marine Biology this coming year. She has also participated and competed in many biology-focused 
                                    Science Olympiad events, like Potions and Poisons and Bio-Process Lab. Further, Victoria is aware 
                                    of the difficulties that come with online learning and is familiar with many graphics programs and 
                                    applications that will combat these difficulties and enhance the learning process.

                                    Janice Cheng is currently a sophomore at Chantilly High School. She has always had a passion for
                                    mathematics ever since elementary school. Since then, she started to further improve on her math skills
                                    by doing competitions such as Math Kangaroo. Beginning in Middle School, she started to participate in
                                    various more competitions such as Mathcounts, AMC 8, AMC 10, and the AIME. She enjoys taking
                                    classes outside of school to further enhance her abilities. Beyond her free time, she likes to practice her
                                    coding skills. She hopes that she can be a better programmer for her school’s Robotics team.

                                    Hi my name Is Jeanie Qi and I am a Junior at TJ. I have always had a passion for
                                    math and as a kid, I continuously sought out extra opportunities to improve my
                                    skills. However, I understand that not everyone has the accessibility to all the
                                    costly tutoring that I had the privilege to receive. That is why I would love to help
                                    out the community and share my knowledge and experience with younger
                                    generations to encourage interests in the mathematics field. I particularly love to
                                    teach Algebra I, but I am available to help tutor anyone below AP BC Calc, which
                                    is the math course I am currently enrolled in at TJ.

                                    David Wei is currently a freshman at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Ever since
                                    elementary school, David enjoys solving math problems and exploring further in the field of mathematics.
                                    Starting in elementary school, David's passion for math sparked when he participated in various math
                                    competitions such as Mathcounts and the AMC series. In elementary school and middle school, he was a
                                    member of the Mathcounts competition team. In eighth grade, David and his team advanced to the state
                                    competition, which was later canceled due to the pandemic. He has also participated in various other math
                                    competitions, such as the AIME, ARML, BMT, etc. Besides math, he also enjoys playing chess and
                                    programming in Python. Additionally, he enjoys solving Rubik’s cubes, with a fastest time of 30 seconds.
                                    David is excited to work with students who have passions in math!

                                    recipient of the Maryam Mirzakhani award in the Virginia-DC-Maryland region. Her team placed first at
                                    the 2020 Math Open at Andover. Her school team also won the first-place team in the Mathcounts
                                    Chapter and she attended the Math Prize for Girls at MIT. She hopes that she will be able to share her

                                    Mackenzie Chen is a junior at McLean High School. Since going into high school, she has 
                                    taken many strides to enhance her appreciation for humanities and encourage others to 
                                    do the same. She has won multiple awards at many writing competitions, including the 
                                    Scholastic Art and Writing Competition, the Great Falls Optimist Club Essay Competition, 
                                    the Virginia PTA Essay Competition, and the Chinese American Parent Association Asian 
                                    American and Pacific Islander Essay Competition. She has also had experience tutoring 
                                    many students in essay writing and reading comprehension skills. In school, Mackenzie 
                                    enjoys writing for the magazine, The Highlander, and for the online publication website 
                                    as a copy editor and an online opinions editor. During her first year of journalism, 
                                    she became Editor-in-Chief, where she oversaw the articles of many reporters and 
                                    approved them for publication. She is also a member of the National English Honor 
                                    Society, one of the many prestigious honor societies at her school. Going forth, 
                                    Mackenzie hopes to help future generations understand the importance of diversity 
                                    and the universal beauty of language.

                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Mackenzie understands that many students her age do not have the same opportunities to 
                                    enrich their knowledge in humanities. She understands that while they have the passion 
                                    and the potential to achieve success, they might not have the chance to execute their 
                                    goals for the future. Mackenzie understands that to foster the new generation of thinkers 
                                    and leaders, everyone must be given a fair shot at their dreams. By joining Illumony, 
                                    she hopes to help underprivileged communities and low-income families have the same chances 
                                    to work towards their future as other more privileged families do. She hopes that her 
                                    passion will give her the drive to expand education to children and teenagers from 
                                    low-income families. One day, she would like to see a world where everyone can achieve 
                                    their dreams without concern for their backgrounds, their gender, their race, or their social status.

                                    she has developed leadership skills and an optimistic mindset. She is an active member of her
                                    community as she has devoted much her time to clubs and school events. In her junior year, she
                                    became a member of the National Honor Society, a nationally recognized and prestigious
                                    organization, at her school. Furthermore, Phoebe is fluent in Cantonese and has been interested
                                    in foreign languages from a young age. She won the &quot;Pride Award&quot; at McLean during her
                                    freshman year for Chinese and a similar award in 8th grade.

                                    Phoebe understands that there are many students in the nation who do not have access to the
                                    same opportunities as her, which may make it more difficult for them to follow their passion.
                                    Because of this, Phoebe hopes that joining Illumony will enable her to provide support to those
                                    less privileged than her. She hopes to make a positive impact on her community by offering them
                                    access to more opportunities that will help them achieve their goals. Ultimately, Phoebe hopes
                                    that her actions will benefit society and promote a sense of unification in her diverse
                                    community.

                                At the age of 16, he interned as a Data Scientist for Nu Borders, helping them develop their first commercial product for 
                                the private sector. He also worked as an ML researcher for WSGMarkets in developing a profitable algorithm to trade FOREX currencies. 
                                In pursuit of his interests in cs integrated with engineering, Suhas has also joined the TJ Remote Operated Vehicle and TJ 
                                Unmanned Aerial Vehicle clubs as a computer vision programmer.

                                 Joaquim Das belongs to the class of 2022 at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. He leads an economic club
                                 at TJ which works on exploring economics in the modern world, in the past, and in theory. In addition, he works for the Healthy

                                 project focuses on synthetic limestone, which produces building aggregates in the process of its creation and also removes carbon dioxide from the

                                 helps underclassmen learn the ins and outs of the sport and lifts weights as well. Joaquim enjoys discussing ideas and learning from others and 
                                 appreciates the opportunity to help others learn about the subjects in which he finds himself engrossed.

                                Charles is a Junior at McLean High School. Starting from a young age, Charles began to develop a strong 
                                interest in the Business and Finance world. He read books and attended stock-oriented courses throughout his teenage years, 
                                contributing to his knowledge and passion for finance. When the Stock market crashed in March 2020, Charles seized the 
                                opportunity to jump in the stock market. Over the next few months, he became familiarized with the world’s financial markets 
                                and began to explore the world of complex financial derivatives in order to find the most lucrative opportunities possible. Due 
                                to his success in this field, Charles decided to found a club at McLean High School called “Financial Market Analysis Organization”. The 
                                purpose behind the club was to improve personal financial literacy among his school and educate others about technical/fundamental stock analysis. 
                                While his club was gaining traction, Charles got involved with business and marketing, placing first overall at his District’s DECA 
                                (Business club) competition and went on to compete at the State-wide competition.

                                <p>
                                “I realized that many people in our community have little to no understanding of the stock market”, Charles explained. “When someone 
                                gains a basic comprehension of investing early on, It indefinitely benefits their financial future. That’s why it’s so important to 
                                teach this information to kids at a young age.” Through Illumony, Charles hopes to work with young, aspiring kids and stimulate 
                                their interests in the world of Business and Finance.
